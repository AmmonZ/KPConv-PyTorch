## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of **Kernel Point Convolution** (KPConv) in PyTorch. *[Work in progress]*

KPConv is also available in [Tensorflow](https://github.com/HuguesTHOMAS/KPConv) (original implementation)
 
KPConv is a point convolution operator presented in our ICCV2019 paper ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08889)). If you find our work useful in your
